\section*{Preferred Courses for Mike Izbicki}

I am willing and able to teach any course in the undergraduate curriculum,
and I am most excited about teaching the following courses:

    CS 260 - Unix and Scripting 

    CS 301 - Numerical Methods 

    CS 331 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms 

    CS 375 - Computers and Society 

    CS 408 - Programming Languages 

    CS 420 - Artificial Intelligence 

    CS 450 - Computability 

    CS 460 - Secure Communication 

\noindent
I also notice that your website does not list courses on either machine learning or data mining,
and I would like to develop them.
I would also like to develop a course on open source software, possibly as one of the special topics courses.

\noindent
For graduate courses, I am interested in teaching:

    CS 530 - Advanced Algorithm Design and Analysis 

    CS 517 - Natural Language Processing 

    CS 519 - Computer Vision 

	CS 535 - Parallel and Distributed Algorithms

\noindent
I would also like to introduce a graduate level course on machine learning and a graduate level course on numerical optimization.

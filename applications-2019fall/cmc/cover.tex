Dear faculty search committee:

\noindent
I am applying for the tenure track position in computer science and mathematical sciences, 
which I learned about from Mariam Salloum.
I'm currently a postdoc at UC Riverside's Data Science Center,
where my research applies machine learning theory to big social media data.
I have experience teaching diverse student populations both in the United States and Korea,
%Prior to that I held teaching appointments in both the United States and Korea, 
%where I taught both undergraduate and graduate students.
and I also have industry experience from 7 years in the US Navy working on cyber-security and nuclear reactors.
I believe this experience makes me a great fit for your department.

\noindent
My research is particularly well suited for a liberal arts college like CMC because I develop machine learning algorithms that will have a positive social impact.
%My research develops machine learning algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees suitable for large scale social media data.
%In particular, social media platforms are generating more data everyday from around the world,
%and I study new large scale learning algorithms designed to better understand this data.
For example, most research analyzing social media messages has focused on only English language messages,
and so we have little understanding of how minority language communities interact online.
To address this issue, I've developed techniques for analyzing the more than 100 non-English languages used everyday on Twitter.
I've also developed techniques to prevent malicious users from corrupting machine learning algorithms with racist messages or fake news.
%A common thread in my research is an emphasis on algorithms with both strong theoretical guarantees and good practical performance.
%I'm particularly interested in creating algorithms that have strong theoretical guarantees to justify their good practical performance.
%methods for robust machine learning that prevent malicious users from teaching 
I'm excited to help CMC students find research projects that use the latest machine learning techniques to improve our world.

%\noindent
%My research develops theoretical methods that make large scale machine learning easier to use.
%In the distributed setting, I focus on algorithms that are easy to implement but still have strong theoretical guarantees.
%For example, I developed the first MapReduce algorithm for convex machine learning algorithms with statistically optimal generalization performance.
%I also have a number of Haskell libraries that develop new programming language features specifically designed for machine learning.
%For example, the \texttt{HerbiePlugin} automatically converts source code into numerically stable forms,
%so programmers don't have to worry about the intricacies of floating point arithmetic.

\noindent
I enjoy teaching,
and I'm able to teach a broad range of courses.
I've previously taught 11 university courses,
which ranged from introductory courses for humanities majors to advanced graduate-level machine learning courses.
Students like my teaching and have consistently rated my ``effectiveness as a teacher overall'' in at least the 80th percentile.
I'm particularly interested in teaching courses on algorithms, statistics, numerical optimization, machine learning, and programming languages,
but I'm also able to teach any course in the undergraduate math or computer science curricula.
I have experience working with students from many cultures in the US and Korea,
and I'm committed to making my classrooms an inclusive environment where all students can succeed.

\noindent
One of my goals as a professor is to help students contribute to open source software.
Open source is particularly important to the mathematical community due to  projects like R, SciPy, Sage, and Octave that make it easy for anyone in the world to make advanced mathematical models.
While at UC Riverside, I designed some of the first courses to teach students how to contribute to open source software,
and the resulting curricula earned an award from SIGCSE's graduate student research competition.
Through these courses and other mentoring, 
I've helped students contribute to and start their own open source projects with collaborators from around the world.
I hope at CMC to offer a course on open source software development
and to integrate open source more closely with the students' other courses.

\noindent
Thank you for your consideration.
If you have any questions,
please do not hesitate to ask.

Regards,

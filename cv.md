### Military experience

I was in the navy from 2004-2011.
Most of this time was spent in training at either the Naval Academy or NNPTC.
I also spent a year working at the naval submarine school,
but I never did a "real deployment."
I left the navy as a conscientious objector based on religious grounds.
The NYTimes did a [rather nice writeup](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/23/nyregion/23objector.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0) of my discharge,
and I have [a number of blog posts](https://izbicki.me/#my%20conscientious%20objector%20discharge) about the topic.
This experience is a hugely important part of my life.
I enjoy sharing it with others, and have given a number of small presentations about it.
If you have any questions, please ask!
